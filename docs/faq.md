## Do I need any previous experience with coding

Not at all!

Our course is specifically designed to be done with no previous coding experience.

## What happens if I miss a tutorial?

Not to worry!

We understand how difficult it can be to juggle your busy work-life balance and have time for coding. For this reason, we record every tutorial for you to watch at your own pace.

From previous experience, students gain the most from attending live - particularly by asking questions and deepening understanding. However, even if you can't make every session, our team will endeavour to help through the MediCode Community Slack channel.

## What's the time commitment?

The course entails 7-8 online evening sessions, each lasting 1.5 hours. These are all recorded.

Each tutorial has associated individual exercises, which can be completed in your own time.

## Do I have to be a doctor?

Nope!

Regardless of whether you're a doctor, a nurse, or another member of the MDT, anyone can become a clinician who codes.
