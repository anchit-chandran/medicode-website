## Do I need any previous experience with coding

Not at all. Our course is specifically designed to be able to be done with no previous experience coding, although familiarity with some of the concepts would obviously help. Whether you're an absolute newbie or just need a refresher on some of the more important concepts in coding, this course is for you.

## What happens if I miss a tutorial?

Not to worry! We understand how difficult it can be to juggle your busy work-life balance and have time for coding as well, so we'll record every tutorial for you to watch at your own pace. Obviously it would be better to attend in person so if you run into any problems you can raise them right there and then, but our helpful team of coders will be able to answer your questions afterwards as well if you get stuck!

The course is a total of around 10 hours long, with opportunities to ask questions and troubleshoot any problems you might have along the way.

## Do I have to be a doctor?

Absolutely not! This code has been written broadly with healthcare in mind. This means whether you're a doctor, a nurse, a PA or another member of the MDT is not important as you'll all be able to appreciate the themes of the course.
