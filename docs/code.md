## How can medics learn Python?
By attending MediCode school!

MediCode has created a comprehensive series of Python tutorials aimed towards medics who are complete coding beginners. 

We intend to host more beginner Python for Medics Crash Courses in the upcoming months. Please register your interest and stay updated with future developments by signing up!

## What does learning to code actually mean?

So you've heard medics should *learn to code*.

What does that **actually** mean?

It's the same as learning a foreign language!

## How I learned German

English is my only fluent language.

In Year 8, I started learning German.

We began with the letters, grammar and syntax. The characters ß (*Eszett*) and ü (*Umlaut*) were new.

We progressed to how letters formed individual words: *die Katze* (the cat), *das Bett* (the bed), and *die Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte* (the black forest gateaux). 

Words are combined into phrases and sentences. In theory, I could write stories, songs and entire scripts. I actually wrote a short play in German. It won second place in the 2015 Oxford German Olympiad.

*Learning to code* is similar to learning German or any language.

You begin by learning your chosen programming language's basic commands, grammar and syntax. 

You put these essential tools into practice.

You learn how commands fit together to make complex programs. You make better programs by learning more and more advanced concepts. 

There's no "end-point" - like medicine, coding is a continual journey.

## How do I start?

*Ok, Anchit, that makes sense, and even though it's really cool you won that German writing prize, I still don't know how to start*.

First, consider why you want to learn to program.

Is it to solve a particular problem? Is there a specific area in your life that could be improved through coding? Is it just for fun?

There are *lots* of different languages, each with pros, cons, and use cases.

These are my recommendations for any medic who's starting their coding journey:

- If you're interested in web development (i.e. anything related to websites or web apps), start with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 

- If you're interested in anything else (particularly data science, machine learning, and MedTech), or you're unsure what you want to do, **learn Python.**
