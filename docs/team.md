Anchit is an ex-doctor who graduated from Imperial College School of Medicine and Imperial Business School and is currently freelancing as a clinical software developer, focussing on Python projects aimed at improving healthcare outcomes. He entered  Medicine to realise positive change on a societal level. However, working in the NHS, he experienced too many barriers and inefficiencies preventing large-scale sustainable change. *Here he decided that the best thing he could do to positively impact society was to use his coding skills in ....*

His favourite language is Python, which he learned through self-teaching from online resources. Though anyone *can* learn to code for free, he founded MediCode when realising there were no tutorials catered to medics. He also has experience with languages such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript, R, and SQL. He holds an internship with Great Ormond Street Hospital's data science team, DRIVE, and is also freelancing as a clinical software developer for clients such as the RCPCH.

His main interests are data science and machine learning. His career aspirations involve applying computational methods to understand the mind, improve mental health, and explore consciousness.
