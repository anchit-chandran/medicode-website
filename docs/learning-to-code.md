So you’ve heard medics should "learn to code".

What does that **actually** mean?

It’s the same as learning a foreign language!

## 🤔 How to learn German

English is my only fluent language.

In Year 8, I started learning **German**.

We began with the letters, grammar and syntax. The characters **ß** (Eszett) and **ü** (Umlaut) were new.

We progressed to how letters formed individual words: *die Katze* (the cat), *das Bett* (the bed), and *die Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte* (the black forest gateux).

Words are combined into phrases and sentences. These are improved through more advanced concepts like reflexive pronouns and dative prepositions. In theory, I could write stories, songs and entire scripts. I actually wrote a short play in German. It won **second place** in the 2015 Oxford German Olympiad.

Learning to code is very similar to learning German, or any language.

## 💡How to learn to code

You begin by learning your chosen programming language's basic commands, grammar and syntax. In Python, you could show a greeting by using the print command:

```python title='Output'
>>> "Hello, I'm Anchit, and I'm one of the doctors!"
```

Then, you learn how commands fit together, like words in a sentence, to make complex programs.

What do you think the output of the following Python code will be:

```python title='Output'
>>> "Tachycardia"
```

You improve by learning more advanced concepts like *Object-Oriented Programming* or data structures and algorithms. With all of these skills, you can create websites from scratch, or delve into creating AI with machine learning.

There’s no “end-point”; like medicine, coding is a continual journey.

## 👩‍🎓 How do I start?

*Ok, Anchit, that all makes sense, and even though it’s really cool you won that German writing prize, I still don’t know how to start.*

First, consider **why** you want to learn to code.

Is it to solve a particular problem? Is there a specific area in your life that could be improved through coding? Is it just for fun?

There are *many* different languages out there, each with its own pros, cons, and use-cases.

Don't get paralysed by the choice paradox. These are my recommendations for any medic starting their coding journey:

- If you’re interested in web development (i.e. anything related to websites or web apps), start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- If you’re interested in anything else (particularly data science, machine learning, and MedTech), or you’re unsure what you want to do, learn Python.
