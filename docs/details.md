We are excited to announce the dates for our next cohort of coding tutorials, starting from the 3rd of July up to 15th of July! 

This will involve **eight** specifically tailored live tutorials where we will go over everything you need to get started in your journey into coding, from your first function all the way to your first neural network.
We've pooled together all the feedback from our previous 2 cohorts to ensure that this will not only be the most comprehensive course we have to offer yet, but also the easiest to understand and the most efficient use of your time.

No coding experience is needed for this course, as it is specifically designed to teach you everything you need to know from the ground up. With this, we hope to give you the tools necessary to create and develop your own coding projects and applications.

## What is Included

- 8 x 1-1.5hr live and interactive tutorials, covering the fundamentals of *Python* - a powerful programming language
