# About the MediCode Course

In medical school, we begin by learning how the human body works.

We're equipped with the tools to approach any new presentation and the knowledge to Google anything we don't know. We then specialise: acquiring a deeper understanding of medicine, performing brain surgery and curing cancer.

**This course is like medical school.**

We teach the fundamentals of Python and how to approach a particular problem.

## Why choose this course?

As a medic, learning to code is daunting.

Tutorials are filled with needless complexity combined with jargon aimed toward programming professionals.

We make it easy.

 As self-taught medic coders, we empathise with the initial struggle.

That's why we created this course to teach the fundamentals of Python. Every lesson is placed within the medical context, answering, "where would I use this?"

After the first hour, you will have created your first program.

After the course, you will have the confidence to independently delve further into any field you choose, such as data science, web development and machine learning.

Coding is a lucrative addition to any medic's skillset, opening up many exciting opportunities within academia, health management and data science.

You can use your medical domain knowledge to identify problems and code to derive innovative solutions.
