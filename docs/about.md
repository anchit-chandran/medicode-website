Medicode started with one simple mission in mind: To help clinicians navigate the rapidly evolving health-tech space easily and with confidence.

As doctors ourselves, we know exactly how daunting it is trying to enter the coding world coming from a healthcare background. We've created this course to make it as simple as possible so that you don't have to encounter the same problems we did when starting out.

Our vision is to distil tech literacy into every clinician, equipping them with tools to create innovative solutions to modern-day problems and revolutionise healthcare.

## Empowering Clinicians with Coding Skills for Innovative Healthcare Solutions

We will empower the next generation of high-impact healthcare professionals to propel positive patient outcomes and lead more meaningful and satisfying careers. More and more of the world is gearing towards novel digital technologies to help boost their productivity, and we believe that healthcare is no exception. Join the cutting edge of development and become one of the ones leading the forefront for innovation in the NHS.
